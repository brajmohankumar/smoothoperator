= Introduction =

This is basically a  sounding board for the future of the product.  Things that may or may not end up actually being features.

= Thoughts =

== Module Installation==

  * Have files available as .gz files (use gzdeflate to expand)
  * Run a cron job to run queued commands - works but is a horrible hack and maybe difficult for people to set up
  * Provide original files, download and put in place one at a time - problem if there is an upgrade
  * Find a way to untar a file after using gzdeflate to expand (then you can use supplied .tar.gz files)
  * Can currently add menu items, but maybe should also be able to add template pages
  * Every module needs to be able to provide configuration options which appear under the settings page when the module is installed.  If a module is removed, these settings should remain, so that if you install it again, you get it set up exactly how you had it
  * Will need to be able to check for the presence of any features that a package requires.  I.E. SmoothTorque needs jpgraph (as does Asterisk-Stat)
