[Installation# Setup and Installation instructions]

Also provides a module repository for easy installation of commercial integration points and software.

Thoughts:

  * Have files available as .gz files (use gzdeflate to expand)
  * Run a cron job to run queued commands - works but is a horrible hack and maybe difficult for people to set up
  * Provide original files, download and put in place one at a time - problem if there is an upgrade
  * Find a way to untar a file after using gzdeflate to expand (then you can use supplied .tar.gz files)
